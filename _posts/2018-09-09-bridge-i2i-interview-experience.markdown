So I recently got a job from __BRIDGEi2i Analytics Solutions__ through the campus placement and thought of sharing my interview experience so that others may find it useful. The job role(s) offered were:- 
* Data Analyst - for undergraduate students 
* Business Analyst - for postgraduate students 

### Round 1 - Online Test 

As usual there is the online test as the first step of the selection process. I don't remember the exact order but the online test had 5 sections: 
* quantitative ability, 
* logical reasoning, 
* statistics, 
* programming theory and 
* pseudo code output.  


There were 90 questions and 120 mins to answer them (No negative marking). The questions were not exactly tough but it was difficult to answer all questions as the time was short. I left 5 questions un-attempted. 

I wasn't confident of the fact that I would qualify for the second round since I didn't know how others had done, but I had some hopes. Finally the list of shortlisted candidates were declared and I was one of them.  

There were about 60 candidates shortlisted from our college and 108 in total(including people from NIT Rourkela) for the GD round.  

### Round 2 - Group Discussion 

The Group Discussion round was pretty interesting we were given a case study. We were each given a sheet of paper in which the case study was defined. I will give a brief idea of how the problem was defined as I don't remember the exact description by heart.  

In the year 1992 Reid had won the election by a 10% margin. He had some characteristic traits that were given like... personality, outlook, focus, democrat, liberal, etc and the classes of people which voted for him in 1992 such as... elderly, academic groups, urban families, NGOs, etc.  
Now in 1998 the competitor is Ensign a new guy, he also had some personality traits such as... radical, republic, divorced etc. and the sections of people who supported him like... young, suburban families, new entrants, etc.  
However this time(1998) Reid less confident about his victory so he has hired you, as an analyst to understand the scenario and draw conclusions about the election results.  
The population details of 1992 and 1998 were given and was pretty detailed. Each sections of the population was given in % values to indicate the population growth within the time period. For example the data was given as follows:-  

class of people | population in 1992  (2.5 million) | population in 1998  (3.4 million)
--- | --- | ---
Male | 49% | 51%
Female | 51% | 49%
Elderly | 44% | 40%
New entrants | 34% | 42%
Urban families | 42% | 39%
Suburban families | 34% | 40%

There were about 15 to 20 such rows and I don't remember all the sections and percentage values.  

Based on the given data the questions were:-  
* Who stands at a better position to win the election?
* What are the key differences between the previos election and this election?
* What can Reid do to be confident or make sure that he has the upper hand in the election?  

Out of the 108 candidates only 30 or 40 were selected for the final round.  

### Round 3 - Personal Interview + HR
