So I recently got a job from __BRIDGEi2i__ through the campus placement and thought of sharing my interview experience so that others may find it useful. The job role(s) offered were:- 
* Data Analyst - for undergraduate students 
* Business Analyst - for postgraduate students 

### Round 1 - Online Test 

As usual there is the online test as the first step of the selection process. I don't remember the exact order but the online test had 5 sections: 
* quantitative ability, 
* logical reasoning, 
* statistics, 
* programming theory and 
* pseudo code output.  


There were 90 questions and 120 mins to answer them (No negative marking). The questions were not exactly tough but it was difficult to answer all questions as the time was short. I left 5 questions un-attempted. 

I wasn't confident of the fact that I would qualify for the second round since I didn't know how others had done, but I had some hopes. Finally the list of shortlisted candidates were declared and I was one of them.

### Round 2 - Group Discussion 

The Group Discussion round was pretty interesting we were given a case study. I will give a brief idea of how the problem was defined as I don't remember the exact description by heart. 

Ekta election year(1999) e Reid jitechilo. Tar bapare kichu details deya chilo... personality, outlook, focus, Democrat or Republican etc and the classes of people which voted for him in 1999.
Ebar 2000 e competitor hocche Ensign a new guy ar tar o kichu personality, details etc deya chilo ar campaign er somoy se kon class of lokeder support pacchilo.
