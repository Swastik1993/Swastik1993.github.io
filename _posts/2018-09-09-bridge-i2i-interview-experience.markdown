So I recently got a job from __Bridge i2i__ through the campus placement and thought of sharing my interview experience so that others may find it useful. The job role(s) offered were - 
* Data Analyst - for undergraduate students 
* Business Analyst - for postgraduate students 

As usual there is the online test as the first step of the selection process. I don't remember the exact order but the online test had 5 sections: 
* quantitative ability, 
* logical reasoning, 
* statistics, 
* programming theory and 
* pseudo code output. 
There were 90 questions and 120 mins to answer them (No negative marking). The questions were not exactly tough but it was difficult to answer all questions as the time was short. I left 5 questions un-attempted. 

I wasn't confident of the fact that I would qualify for the second round since I didn't know how others had done, but I had some hopes. 

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
